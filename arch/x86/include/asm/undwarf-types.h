 * The UNDWARF_REG_* registers are base registers which are used to find other
 * registers on the stack.
 *
 * The CFA (call frame address) is the value of the stack pointer on the
 * previous frame, i.e. the caller's SP before it called the callee.
 *
 * The CFA is usually based on SP, unless a frame pointer has been saved, in
 * which case it's based on BP.
 *
 * BP is usually either based on CFA or is undefined (meaning its value didn't
 * change for the current frame).
 *
 * So the CFA base is usually either SP or BP, and the FP base is usually either
 * CFA or undefined.  The rest of the base registers are needed for special
 * cases like entry code and gcc aligned stacks.
